# Resume-Projects

Hermite and Hermite Beamer are both associated with a project from my Technology for Professional Math and Statistics class wherein I wanted to make a tool to approximate functions using Hermite polynomials in Mathematica. If you would like to look at the Hermite code, you'll need to dowload it and run it in Mathematica, here on github it looks like a garbled mess. 

"Project Report Final" is the Final Project from my Data Mining and Statistical learning class where I attempted to use Trees and a neural network to classify Oklahoma county voters political affiliation.
